## What

* A hiring challenge for new employees.


### Goals

* Assessment
  * Figure out if someone can do hacking, by giving them a target we can observe them attacking
  * Small, can be done in somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour for a junior, probably minutes for a senior
  * See if they're a culture fit
* For the assessing team
  * Make this easy to observe, and easy to grade
  * No silly tricks that means someone needs to sit there for hours to remember how to do a padding oracle attack
  * Can be spun up quickly
